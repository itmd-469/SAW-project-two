# 500-words proposal outlining a significant future improvement to the project

Hello Professor Stolley,

We did most of the revisions that you recommended we do from the project 2 final turn-in.  Because of this, we were not sure what could be accomplished or changed from those revisions.  Instead, I am going to try to come up with some other ways for future improvements of this project.

We did upgrade the checkerboards layout and design for the project 3 turn-in, but for a future improvement, what we could do, is make the board and the checker pieces themselves have a 3D visual appearance and layout to them.  You could accomplish this by changing up your CSS code and the layout.pug file.  By implementing this future improvement, you could add a birds-eye view point (looking over the players shoulder from an angle), a players view-point (sitting behind the board and seeing your opponents pieces), or a side-view where you can see each others checker pieces at an equal distance.  I am sure this has been done somewhere in the world, but that would be one nifty future improvement.

Another future improvement we thought of was a mobile-first design.  We would have to add a @media-query screen in our CSS file, and adjust its modifications and tags to that of a mobile device, such as a smartphone.  We could even take this concept another step further by implementing a tablet-screen design by adding another @media-query screen in the CSS file, and adjust that as well to what would look visually appealing on a tablet.

The last two future improvements that we thought of were further updating the chat box that we have implemented on the website, and a multipeer video chat.  for the chat box, you could add a section that allows users to send emojis back and forth towards each other, GIFS, and photos of your liking.  Another cool feature were to grant the player access to change the layout and visuals of the chat box itself, from the color of the background, font, and message bubble, to the font-style itself and how big you want to make the font.  As for the multipeer video chat, that is something we would all still need to learn how to implement, but it would be pretty neat to give permission to those who want to hop on a spectator room and watch the current checkers match, while having their video and microphones on during the match.  For the sanity of the players, they can choose who they would want to listen to, and who they would want to mute, since the world is full of trolls these days :).  

These are all of the future improvements that we had thought of but I am sure there are many more that have not even scratched the surface.  If these improvements are acceptable, please let us know because we highly enjoyed doing this project and think its a neat website we can show our peers in our success of your classroom!

Kind regards,
